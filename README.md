# SCW Module 1: A YOLO-based Automated System for Real-time 3D Printer State Monitoring
This is the object detection module for the Smart Connect Worker project funded and supervised by California State University Northridge Department of Energy.
This is the Python implementation regarding the YOLO-based object detection model as well as the machine state filtering algorithm as proposed in the published [ICCS 2021 conference paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dvMl7bOjjt8JzsBF6P7kSXNZ-KeLhodt/view?usp=sharing).
